    - Part of my internship project at Shamal Holdings, Dubai.

    - Experimented with SARIMAX and ARIMAX models. Since the difference in model performance was negligible due to non-seasonality, we went ahead with ARIMAX model.
    - Correlation matrix along with forecasted results were presented to the business stakeholders.

    - Dataset was downloaded from Apple Machine Learning research library (Sep-28K) and Kaggle.
    - Feature engineering was implemented by converting the audio files into 16KHz mono wav audio and finally into MFCC and chroma features suing librosa library.
    - For Sep-28K dataset, I also used audio transcriptions using Open-ai whisper library.
    - DistilBert model was chosen for this project since its the lightweight version of BERT.
    - The model was trained on the encodings generated from the audio transcriptions.
    - A simple 3 layer feed forward neural network was created to generated emebeddings from MFCC and Chroma features.
    - The final output prediction is combinational output from DistilBert model and Neural Network model.
